            <div>Jazz Dance is a performance dance and style that arose in the United States in the early 20th century.</div>
            <br>
            <div>Jazz Dance may allude to vernacular Jazz, Broadway or dramatic Jazz. </div>
            <br>
            <div>The two types expand on African American vernacular styles of dance that arose with Jazz Music. </div>
            <br>
            <div>Vernacular dance refers to dance forms that emerge from everyday life and cultural practices of a specific community,</div>
            <div>often reflecting the social, cultural, and historical contexts of that community.</div>
            <br>
            <div>In the context of African American culture, vernacular dance encompasses styles that developed organically within African American communities,</div>
            <div> influenced by African traditions, European dance forms, and the unique experiences of African Americans in the United States.</div>

                <h2>5 Jazz Dance Moves</h2>

                <h3>Jazz walk</h3>
                <div>Jazz walks are a stylish form of dance walking with tiptoeing steps. Start with your knees slightly bent and your shoulders rolled back. Then step while tiptoeing. Jazz walk routines can vary depending on the direction of the steps.</div>

                <h3>Ball Change Cross</h3>
                <div>In ball change, you use the balls of your feet to quickly transfer weight from one foot to the next. Then do the cross by crossing one leg forward to the other side. </div>

                <h3>Box Step or Jazz Square</h3>
                <div>It's a four-step movement making a square pattern on the floor. Start by using your right foot to step in front, then use your left foot to cross towards your right, then your right foot step back, and lastly, use your left foot to step towards your left. Repeat this multiple times, and that's your jazz square.
                    Note that you can also change the direction, as long as it forms a square pattern.</div>

                <h3>Pirouette</h3>
                <div>Pirouette is executed by turning your body using one foot. In jazz, prepare by first putting your left foot back with its back hill lifted up. Your arms should be on the same level as your chest while bending your knees slightly. Then, give enough push to turn while lifting your left leg up and putting the weight on your right front hill.</div>

                <h3>Chasse</h3>
                <div>Chasse is a step-together-step movement where you step your right leg out, then hop, bringing your left foot up to meet your right foot before landing. You can also change sides by starting with your left leg out.</div>

             </div>

             <div class="history">

                  <h2>The History Of Jazz Dance</h2>
                  <div>Jazz dance originated in the early 20th century in African American communities, blending African and European dance styles with syncopated rhythms and improvisation. It gained popularity in the United States during the Harlem Renaissance.</div>
                  <br>
                  <div>In the 1920s, jazz dance became synonymous with the Jazz Age. The Charleston, known for its fast footwork and energetic movements, became an iconic dance of this era and a symbol of the Roaring Twenties.</div>
                  <br>
                  <div>During the 1930s, the Swing Era emerged, with big band jazz music dominating the scene. The Lindy Hop, a high-energy dance that combined jazz, tap, and Charleston, became immensely popular and spread worldwide.</div>
                  <br>
                  <div>In the 1950s, jazz dance evolved as choreographers began incorporating modern dance and ballet elements. This transformation created a more structured form of jazz dance, which became prominent in Broadway musicals and dance concerts, showcasing its versatility and creativity.</div>
