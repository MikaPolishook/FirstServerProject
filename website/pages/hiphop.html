                <h2>5 Hip Hop Dance Styles</h2>

                <h3>Freestyle:</h3>
                <div>Freestyle hip hop dancers improvise their movements, using their skills to create a fluid dance without choreography. Experienced dancers already know movements that work well together, making it easier to create spontaneous flow.</div>
                <br>
                <h3>Krumping:</h3>
                <div>This African American form of dance is driven by pure emotion and force. Krumping is defined by energetic and powerful movements like chest bumping, often expressing strong feelings in a lyrical way.</div>
                <br>
                <h3>Popping:</h3>
                <div> This dance style is marked by a quick contraction of muscles to create a jerking effect in the dancer's body. Nearly every part of the body can be popped, which can create a surreal and robotic effect.</div>
                <br>
                <h3>Locking:</h3>
                <div>In this style of hip hop dance, the dancer quickly and frequently moves their body and freezes it in place. It is similar to popping, but holding positions longer than with popping.</div>
                <br>
                <h3>Breakdancing:</h3>
                <div>Breakdancing is very closely associated with hip hop, though it's often seen as its own distinct style of dance. This acrobatic style popularized by B-boys and B-girls is marked by complicated floor-work, often involving spinning and contorting.</div>
