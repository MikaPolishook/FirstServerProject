  <h1 id="Title">Ballet</h1>

   <div class="ExplainBallet">
      <br>
      <div>Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia.</div>
      <br>
      <div>It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary.</div>
      <br>
      <div>Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and cultures.</div>
      <br>
      <div>Various schools around the world have incorporated their own cultures. </div>
      <br>
      <div>As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.</div>

         <h2>Unique Movements Or Techniques:</h2>
         <h3>Arabesque:</h3>
         <div>When one leg supports the body, while the other leg extends horizontally and backward.</div>
         <br>
         <h3>Developpé:</h3>
         <div>Meaning “to develop.” Moving one leg up to the knee of the standing leg and slowly extending it in the air, holding the hips square according to the direction the dancer is facing.</div>
         <br>
         <h3>Pirouettes:</h3>
         <div>Spins dancers make when they turn around one of their legs while the other is off the ground and in a position.</div>
     </div>

     <div class="types">
          <h2>4 Types of Ballet:</h2>
          <h3>Classical Ballet:</h3>
          <div>A traditional form featuring a full orchestra and story-driven narratives. It emphasizes weightlessness and extended lines of the ballerinas' movements. Sets and costumes complement the story. The American Ballet Theatre and ballets like The Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake are examples of this style.</div>
          <br>
          <h3>Romantic Ballet:</h3>
          <div> Developed in the nineteenth century, focused on emotion, lyricism, and drama. It introduced key elements like pointe work and tutus and saw more female dancers taking the lead. La Sylphide is an example of romantic ballet.</div>
          <br>
          <h3>Neoclassical Ballet:</h3>
          <div>Starting in the 1920s, this style brought abstract ideas to ballet as a reaction to romanticism. It stripped away ornate set decorations and over-dramatized performance. Ballet master George Balanchine influenced the style.</div>
          <br>
          <h3>Contemporary Ballet:</h3>
          <div>This style blends elements of classical ballet and modern dance, with some acting and mime work. Modern ballet also employs typical pointe work (though it's sometimes also performed barefoot) while allowing for more upper body movement.</div>
     </div>

      <div class="history">
            <h2>How It Started?</h2>
            <div>Ballet began around 1500 in Italy, with the word "ballet" stemming from the Italian "ballare," meaning "to dance." Catherine de Medici brought early dance styles to the French court after marrying King Henry II. Dancers wore restrictive costumes, and movements were small hops, slides, and curtsies.</div>
            <br>
            <div>Ballet terminology was codified in French over the next 100 years. During Louis XIV's reign, he performed popular dances, and professional dancers were hired for court events. Performances grew larger and were held on elevated platforms for better audience viewing.</div>
            <br>
            <div>By 1850, Russia became a leading ballet center. Pointe dancing became popular, with women performing in bell-shaped skirts. Romantic ballet focused on pure, heroic female characters.</div>
            <br>
            <div>In the early 20th century, Serge Diaghilev formed the Ballet Russes, which toured Europe and America. Ballet grew in the U.S. in the 1930s with dancers like George Balanchine, who founded the New York City Ballet, and Adolph Bolm, the first director of the San Francisco Ballet School.</div>

        <div id="videoExplain">Peter Wright's production of *The Nutcracker* for The Royal Ballet is one of the most enduring versions of the ballet. With its festive setting, dancing snowflakes, and enchanting stage magic, it has become a beloved Christmas tradition. Based loosely on E.T.A. Hoffmann's story, the ballet opens with a lively Christmas party at the Stahlbaum family home. Wright's choreography includes elements from the original 1892 ballet, including the famous pas de deux for the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Prince. The production also highlights the touching relationship between Clara and the Nutcracker Prince, adding a layer of first love.</div>
